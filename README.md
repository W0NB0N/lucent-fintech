🌌 Lucent — Illuminate Your Finances

Lucent is a next-generation, AI-powered financial management platform that centralizes your entire financial life — banking, investments, crypto, budgeting, and group expenses — all in one place.

“Illuminate your finances. Empower your freedom.”

🚀 Overview

Most people want to achieve financial freedom by 30, but have no idea where their money goes.
They juggle between 6+ apps — one for banking, one for stocks, one for crypto, another for expenses — and still lack a single, unified picture of their finances.

Lucent fixes that.

Lucent is your personal financial command center — a dashboard that brings together all your money, insights, and goals in one clean, beautiful, intelligent place.

✨ Key Features
💰 Unified Financial Dashboard

View your entire financial life — bank balance, investments, crypto, real estate, and savings — all in one place.
Each section is represented through customizable widgets that you can add, remove, or rearrange to your liking.

📊 AI-Powered Financial Advisor

An integrated LLM-based assistant that gives you personalized insights:

How you’re spending, saving, and investing

Where to optimize your portfolio

How much to invest monthly to hit your FIRE number (Financial Independence, Retire Early)

🔥 FIRE Tracker

Lucent automatically calculates your FIRE Number — the investment target required to retire early and live off returns — and tracks your progress toward it.

💸 Lucent Circles

Split group expenses effortlessly.

Create circles for roommates, trips, or parties

Upload or scan bills using OCR (even from WhatsApp images!)

The AI detects who ordered what — non-veg, drinks, etc. — and splits bills fairly

Initially, members get notifications

Later, UPI integration enables direct payments

📈 Trends

Real-time updates from:

Stock markets (via Twelve Data or Finnhub APIs)

Crypto (via CoinGecko API)

Personalized market insights
All visualized beautifully in charts and graphs.

🧩 Widget Customization

Every user can customize their dashboard:

Add/remove widgets like Net Worth, Budget, Investments, Crypto Tracker, or Daily Financial Health

Click any widget to navigate to its dedicated page for detailed analytics

🧠 Daily Financial Health Widget

Shows how you’re performing financially today — income, expenses, savings rate — summarized as a daily financial wellness percentage.
